Project Behind Enemy Lines

Welcome User!

Our game, Behind Enemy Lines is a text based RPG game that closely resembles the 1970s terminal game Zork. 
In this game, you are an Allied Drop Trooper whose parachute has landed deep behind Nazi battle lines. 
Your objective is to return to your squadron or die trying. You will have to fight, talk, an wander your way back. 
You will also have to eat and find guns, complete quests an kill bosses. 

Best of luck soldier, now FALL OUT!

Instructions for use:

1. To start our game you must first download the folder containing all the game files (As you are reading this, 
   I can safely assume you've alreay done this).

2. Open up Command Prompt (or Terminal in Mac or Ubuntu).

3. From there using the cd command, change your directory until you get to the folder that contains the game folders.

4. Now you must write the command javac then each java file name in the folder (e.g: >javac GamePlay.java).

5. After doing this for every java file, you must type in this command: >java GamePlay.

Your game should start and the instructions from there should be fairly simple to follow.
